## ECE Department's File & Information Management System


EDFIMS (ECE Department's File & Information Management System) is an online web application which was created as an internship project under the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Tezpur University. This application was created using PHP, SQL, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

This application facilitates the private sharing of notices and files from the administrator to the faculty of the department. Faculties can view and download the files uploaded specifically to them.

The administrator (usually the Head-Of-Department) has their login credentials already dumped inside the database. The faculty members, should they wish to join the system, must fill and submit an account request (the access to which is available uunder the login panel at index.php), to the administrator. The administrator can then view the requests and activate/deactivate or delete any faculty account should they deem necessary at any moment of his desire. 

After the activation of their account, the faculty members can login to their user accounts via their Institutional E-mail ID and password, which they provided on the request form.

Features to change passwords or view/download/delete notices have been provided to every user, be it faculty or administrator. Every user can view all files and notices in a tabular format with dates of upload.

This system is an outcome of the Summer Internship 2022, done at the department of ECE, Tezpur University.
